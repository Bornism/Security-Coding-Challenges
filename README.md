# Security Coding Challenges
Below is a list of security coding challenges that I have personally worked on to get a better understanding around.

I worked on these projects in my personal time to get a better understanding of the requirements surrounding different security challenges. These applications are used in todays threat landscape and it was important for me to understand holistically what the base requirements of making these applications could do for me as a security professional.

Most of the projects were created after watching other professionals create them from start to finish. I did my very best to not copy any code such as variables and functions to get a better picture overall. 

Projects:

• Port Scanner - Completed

• Ceasar Cipher - Completed

• Parse Arb Logs - Completed

• Web Scraper

• SSH Botnet - Completed

• Password Bruteforcer - Completed

• Metadata Scraper from PDFs - Completed

• Recover Deleted Items
