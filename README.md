Below is a list of security coding challenges that I have personally worked on to get a better understanding around.

I worked on these projects in my personal time to get a better understanding of the requirements surrounding different security challenges. These applications are used in todays threat landscape and it was important for me to understand holistically what the base requirements of making these applications could do for me as a security professional. 

Projects:
• Port Scanner

• Ceasar Cipher

• Parse Arb Logs
• Web Scraper
• SSH Botnet
• Password Bruteforcer
• Metadata Scraper from PDFs
